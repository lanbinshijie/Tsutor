### Background 📜

"I recently found many quality journals on GitHub. Due to various constraints, I couldn't access them freely. So, I created Tsutor, integrating Python, Flask, and web scraping. It regularly updates the material list, pulling from GitHub repositories. Users can select and dive into their desired journals. If you appreciate this initiative, don't forget to star it on GitHub! 😄"
